        Hey there, I'm Brian Kim, and I'm excited to connect with you. I've got
        a background that is a bit diverse â€“ a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology
        with a minor in Psychology, and yep, I also used to be a certified
        personal trainer. But you know what ties it all together? My unwavering
        passion for learning and creating. Currently I work part-time in the
        restaurant industry and laundry cleaning industry while I study data
        structure and algorithm problems, building projects, and applying to
        Software engineering Jobs!
